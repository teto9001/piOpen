	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<strong>When this will be ready?</strong> I don't know!<br>
	<strong>Can I build one?</strong> Of course! And tell me if it works, I need some feedback.<br>
        <strong>Can I buy one?</strong> No, I only have one piOpen and I'm using it for developing!<br>
        <strong>Who are you?</strong> I'm a guy working in the home automation. And I'm astonished that in 2012 there is an app for everything, except for opening your automatic gate. Every house has an automatic gate/door! Damn!<br>
